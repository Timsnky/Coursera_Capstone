## Battle Of The Neighbourhoods

This project provides an analysis of the various neighbourhoods in the City of Toronto. The process is to first segment the City into different neighborhoods using the geographical coordinates of the center of each neighborhood, and then using a combination of location data from FourSquare and machine learning,we group the neighbourhoods into clusters.
